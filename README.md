# RFID-Card-Skimming

## About 

RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) technology uses radio-frequency magnetic fields to identify, read and capture information stored on an electronic chip attached to an object. Due to its cost-effectiveness, speed of operation, and ease of use, RFID technology is used more on Hotel room cards, ATM cards, credit and debit cards. Since the use of this technology is increasing, this makes it the target of many cyber criminals who might target RFID chips to siphon money or steal information without the victim's knowing about it. This project was a university project under FC411 Secure Network Design course and focued on reading and cloning Hotel card information by using the <a href="https://proxmark.com/">Proxmark3</a>, which is a tool used by security researchers to test the security of RFID systems.

## Project Objectives

1. Identify vulnerabilities in systems from a hacker's perspective to make them more secure.
2. Identify how RFID can be hacked, RFID hackers have demonstrated how easy it is to get hold of information within RFID chips.
3. More cards are being skimmed using RFID technology; if we are aware of the common skimming hacking techniques, we can prevent it.
4. If we are knowledgeable about skimming methods, we might be able to utilize them to steer clear of other types of cybercrime.

## How This Project Is Done

The project has been done by using the RFID technique to read and capture the information that is stored on the cards. we used the Proxmark3 and the Magic Cards that were used to paste the information on it. The Proxmark3 was able to read the identification number and the information on a hotel card and then by using the reader software we were able to see this information and copy it onto another card.

## What I learned 

The project provided me with a better understanding of RFID technology and its applications in industries such as hotels and security systems. I learned about how the Proxmark3 device works and how it is used to capture information stored on an RFID card.  Also, I gained an appreciation for the security vulnerabilities of RFID systems and the importance of protecting sensitive information stored on RFID cards. The project truly helped me develop technical skills in using the Proxmark3 device and software, as well as in analyzing and interpreting data captured from an RFID card. My teammates and I ended up reading through vast documentation to learn more about the RFID technique and Proxmark3 device and we marched forwards with full attention and effort until we made it through.
