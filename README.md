# RFID-Card-Skimming

## About 

RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) technology uses radio-frequency magnetic fields to identify, read and capture information stored on an electronic chip attached to an object. Due to its cost-effectiveness, speed of operation, and ease of use, RFID technology is used more on Hotel room cards, ATM cards, credit and debit cards. Since the use of this technology is increasing, this makes it the target of many cyber criminals who might target RFID chips to siphon money or steal information without the victim's knowing about it. This project was a university project under FC411 Secure Network Design course and focued on reading and cloning Hotel card information by using the <a href="https://proxmark.com/">Proxmark3</a>, which is a tool used by security researchers to test the security of RFID systems.

## Project Objectives

1. Identify vulnerabilities in systems from a hacker's perspective to make them more secure.
2. Identify how RFID can be hacked, RFID hackers have demonstrated how easy it is to get hold of information within RFID chips.
3. More cards are being skimmed using RFID technology; if we are aware of the common skimming hacking techniques, we can prevent it.
4. If we are knowledgeable about skimming methods, we might be able to utilize them to steer clear of other types of cybercrime.
